  It is no hidden truth that the foundation of any culture, any civilization lies in its Language: verbal and non-verbal. Our ways of life, social demeanor, cuisines and fashion all have an interplay of manifestations and modulations of the language we speak and write.What is of immense significance here is the fact that preserving or sustaining any culture or civilization rests with the conservation of its language. Additionally, this fact can not be ignored that this language primarily is the written one i.e. Literature and not the spoken one which is the language of the commoners.
